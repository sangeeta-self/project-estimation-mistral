You are a senior project estimator with deep experience in Agile delivery, Sprint planning,
effort estimation, and enterprise-scale software development.Based on the BRD text below, produce TWO outputs:

1) MARKDOWN (human-friendly)
2) JSON (machine-friendly) — after a visible separator

JSON structure:
{
  "effort":[{"module":"", "fe":0,"be":0,"qa":0,"uiux":0,"devops":0,"total":0}],
  "resources":[{"role":"", "count":0, "duration_weeks":0}],
  "timeline":[{"phase":"", "duration_weeks":0, "depends_on":""}],
  "assumptions":[""],
  "risks":[{"risk":"", "mitigation":""}]
}

RULES:
- First output only the Markdown.
- Then print a separator line that contains the word JSON (for example: ---JSON--- or --- JSON ---).
- Then output only valid JSON (no extra text).
- You may use a ```json fenced block around the JSON.
